I spatially joined Census and Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance Data to show the % of the population that is between 15 and 19 years old in
each community statistical area in Baltimore. This data engineering process can be recreated with other census data, such as race, income, health and other data 
census level data. Telling data stories on a community statistical area level in Baltimore is important because the city is largely divided by neighborhood and
many residents identify with their neighborhood.
