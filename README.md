I spatially joined Census and Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance Data to show the % of the population that is between 15 and 19 years old in
each community statistical area in Baltimore. While this data engineering process was for a specific story, it can be recreated with other census data, such as race, income, health and other census level data. 

Telling data stories on a community statistical area level in Baltimore is important because the city is largely divided by neighborhood and
many residents identify with their neighborhood.
